Infrastructure


Every planet should have port capacities and refueling costs

Ideally then orders placed between planets would then take the cheapest route. (Distance should take time). Like departing from earth to refuel on mars to fly Saturn.

Show with arrows
Show speed and cargo size 
Show arrival date.

Show destinations and arrivals

Every month new orders are made. Only creating shipping lanes with cargo from last month.

Level should increase log. So lvl 5 is at least 16 times more than lvl 1 



Also maybe calculate if it is efficient to deliver some wares, and then return some wares.


Shouldl work kinda liek real world shipping things.



Game should also take tick every month on normal speed so 4 sec for a month
