Yet Another Planet Game.  
A Game i have made in my freetime in Unity 2022.2

## What is it about
The currently is just a simulation of the planets revolving around the sun, while small spaceships travels from one to the other.  

## Purpose of code
In the game i have tried to practice Data Oriented Design, and a good MVC layout, to make the code better structured.

## .
When i started i barely knew anything about orbital mechanics, but through the project i had to learn the math behind it.
